This project is an example of a task that represents some of the work required for a number of our law firm's cases. Due to the confidential nature of the original task, a small sample was recreated using fictional data as an example. Our client had handwritten the defendant's personal credit card charges by category by hand, which was several hundred pages long. In a short amount of time, we were instructed to type these into spreadsheets so that we would have a cleaner copy to provide to the judge. In order to make things more proficient, the charts were transcribed by chatgpt. Since there were large number of mistakes during this process, I used a combination of SQL and Python to clean up the spreadsheets. This project shows several of the methods I used to make sure the bates number was consistent, to make sure the vendors were spelled correctly and the multiple version of the same vendor were combined. Several functions were made in python in order to create new columns to assign the correct exhibit and trial binder numbers to the bates range provided. While these charts still had to be manually reviewed for certain areas, I was able to save a significant amount of time by using SQL and Python to clean the data.
